            Broad U.S.A. is committed to the inherent value and flexible
            solutions that thermally driven absorption plays in our modern
            world. Absorption design is our core competency and primary focus.
            Unlike many current players in the absorption market, Broad designed
            and created its first Absorption Chiller in 1988 with its own human
            capital and innovation, hard work, and the continuous drive to be
            the best.
